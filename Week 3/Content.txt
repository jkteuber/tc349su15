Release information: Date & Systems
-The game will be releasing on PS4 and PC on July 7th. By preordering for the PS4 you will receive a unique vehicle
that will only be available through preordering.

Goal of the game
-The goal of the game is simple: to make the ball go into your opponent's net.
-The difficult part is getting the ball past the opponents and making it go where you want to go. 
-Directing the ball where you want to go is easy as a person, but not so easy when you are using a car.

Game mechanics
-You are controlling a rocket car with jumping ability, as well as boost.
-Boost can be used to increase your speed for those critical moments where you need to catch the ball.
-Boost can be refilled by running over boost pads located at different points on the map.
-You can redirect your car mid-air in order to change how you hit the ball.
-Check the wiki for more information and tutorials.
