Project Brief: Rocket League

Rocket League is a new game coming out this summer for PC and PS4. The game is similar to Soccer, but with rocket cars as players. The game is being developed by Psyonix and is the sequel to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars. The anticipation of the game has greatly risen over the past month, and the game is in need of a new website to give more information to people interested, as well as to showcase the game. The site should be photo-centric, as well as include multiple videos for showcasing the game. The website should also have an easy to find page for information about the game, such as the mechanics and planned release date.
