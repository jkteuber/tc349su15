Style Tile vs. Comp

I prefer creating comps over style tiles for multiple reasons. The first reason is to get a good idea of 
what the site will actually look like when it is fully put together. The style tile will give you a good idea of the 
theme of the webpage, but is unable to show you how the items will work together in the final piece.
The second reason is the style tile is very limited in what you can show, and doesn't allow you to iterate on the 
actually site layout. The site layout is very important for the final design, and can go through many iterations
just as the color design will. A comp will allow you to see the layout and the style at the same time, 
allowing you to judge and make changes to both at the same time.

I spent about 20 minutes on the style tiles and 40 on the comp.
